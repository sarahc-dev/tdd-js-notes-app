# Todo List App

I want to make a simple CRUD app so that I can focus on process and also go on to make the same app utilising and learning different backend frameworks. I will be strictly using TDD throughout.

You will be able to create a todo, mark it as complete or not, see all items in your todo list, edit and delete todos.

In the frontend, I will use React and Next.js (along with TypeScript, TailwindCSS) as recommended in the React docs. I will use Cypress for both end-to-end and component testing and I intend to build this both with separate backends as well as using Next.js' own serverless architecture.

For the database, I will be using MongoDB.
